Sentimental Tweets allows users to browse selected celebrities tweets, create accounts, and save favorite celebs in their settings. 
Users can pick a verified celebrity or celebrities (for ethical use of the app, non verified users are exempt), and pull their tweets for that week. If multiple Twitter users are chosen, their tweets will be placed side by side on the interface. Guests can browse Twitter users, but not save them.
The purpose of this app is to watch the people who you are interested in and analyze their week. Whether you are a curious fan, in PR and need to view celeb image, or a voter keeping track of the mood that week, the app can be used for your needs.
